        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>About Me:

            Hello! I'm Mahmoud El Mehdi El Khadiri, a highly motivated and skilled web engineer with a strong background in modeling and computer science engineering. Born on August 13th, 2001, I am a Moroccan national with excellent communication skills in both Arabic and English, as well as a strong proficiency in French.
            
            I have experience developing web applications using Python/Flask for back-end and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end. Additionally, I have developed mobile applications using Android Studio and Java programming language. My technical skills span across various programming languages and technologies, including Python, Java, C#, C, C++, R (statistical programming language), MATLAB, SQL, and machine learning, among others.
            
            I am currently pursuing my fourth year of engineering studies at Ecole Mohamadia d'ingénieurs, where I have been focusing on modeling and computer science engineering. This includes studying statistical and financial mathematics and physics. Prior to this, I completed preparatory classes in MPSI/MP at Lycée Mohamed 6 Kenitra, followed by a science and math baccalaureate at Groupe Pédagogique Alpha, where I graduated with a "Very Good" mention.
            
            Throughout my academic journey, I have successfully completed numerous projects and internships, showcasing my ability to learn quickly, adapt to new technologies, and deliver results under pressure. I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge in the field of technology, mathematics, and finance.
            
            With my strong technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and passion for continuous learning, I am committed to making a significant impact in the world of technology and engineering.
            
            Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my projects and experiences or get in touch with me through the contact section.</p>

        <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Bezout Coefficient Calculator</h3>
            <p>Developed a Python function that, given two co-prime numbers, returns their respective Bezout coefficients. The function is based on the Euclid and Bezout algorithms and was presented and accepted by a jury as a realistic solution.</p>
            <h3>Web Application Development</h3>
            <p>Completed a web application development project during my internship at MAST-ENGINEERING. The project involved creating a web application using Python/Flask for back-end and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end.</p>
            <h3>Mobile Application Development</h3>
            <p>As part of my internship at MAST-ENGINEERING, I developed a mobile application using Android Studio and Java programming language. This experience allowed me to gain valuable insights into mobile app development and software engineering concepts.</p>
            <h3>Finite Elements Method in MATLAB</h3>
            <p>Developed a series of MATLAB functions to execute the finite elements method in 2D for two cases: Laplace equation and its corresponding with the second term. This school project required a significant amount of focus and effort.</p>
            <h3>Time Series Model for Weather Prediction</h3>
            <p>Created a machine learning model for predicting the weather in the USA using the statistical programming language R. The project involved working with time series data and developing a robust prediction model.</p>
            <h3 class="card-title">Stock Management and Gantt Diagram Visualization</h3>
            <p class="card-text">Developed Python functions to determine the optimal stock command and security for an enterprise, as well as functions to visualize the Gantt diagram. This project was completed as part of my school coursework.</p>
            <h3 class="card-title">Moroccan Yield Curve Prediction</h3>
            <p class="card-text">In my most extensive project to date, I predicted the Moroccan yield curve using the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson model. The project involved data collection, cleansing (using the random forest regressor), and training/fitting the model.</p>
